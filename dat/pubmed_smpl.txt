AB  - CONTEXT: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancers worldwide.
      Understanding the epidemiology and risk factors of the disease is paramount to
      improve primary and secondary prevention strategies. OBJECTIVE: To systematically
      review and summarize the current evidence on the descriptive epidemiology, large
      screening studies, diagnostic techniques, and risk factors of PCa. EVIDENCE
      ACQUISITION: PCa incidence and mortality rates for 2020 were obtained from the
      GLOBOCAN database of the International Agency for Research on Cancer. A
      systematic search was performed in July 2022 using PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE
      biomedical databases. The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines and was
      registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022359728). EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Globally, PCa is the
      second most common cancer, with the highest incidence in North and South America,
      Europe, Australia, and the Caribbean. Risk factors include age, family history,
      and genetic predisposition. Additional factors may include smoking, diet,
      physical activity, specific medications, and occupational factors. As PCa
      screening has become more accepted, newer approaches such as magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) and biomarkers have been implemented to identify patients who are
      likely to harbor significant tumors. Limitations of this review include the
      evidence being derived from meta-analyses of mostly retrospective studies.
      CONCLUSIONS: PCa remains the second most common cancer among men worldwide. PCa
      screening is gaining acceptance and will likely reduce PCa mortality at the cost
      of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Increasing use of MRI and biomarkers for the
      detection of PCa may mitigate some of the negative consequences of screening.
      PATIENT SUMMARY: Prostate cancer (PCa) remains the second most common cancer
      among men, and screening for PCa is likely to increase in the future. Improved
      diagnostic techniques can help reduce the number of men who need to be diagnosed
      and treated to save one life. Avoidable risk factors for PCa may include factors
      such as smoking, diet, physical activity, specific medications, and certain
      occupations.

AB  - CONTEXT: Previous studies have reported significant variation in prostate cancer
      rates and trends mainly due to differences in detection practices, availability
      of treatment, and underlying genetic susceptibility. OBJECTIVE: To assess recent
      worldwide prostate cancer incidence, mortality rates, and trends using up-to-date
      incidence and mortality data. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We present estimated
      age-standardized prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates by country and
      world regions for 2018 based on the GLOBOCAN database. We also examined rates and
      temporal trends for incidence (44 countries) and mortality (76 countries) based
      on data series from population-based registries. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The highest
      estimated incidence rates were found in Australia/New Zealand, Northern America,
      Western and Northern Europe, and the Caribbean, and the lowest rates were found
      in South-Central Asia, Northern Africa, and South-Eastern and Eastern Asia. The
      highest estimated mortality rates were found in the Caribbean (Barbados, Trinidad
      and Tobago, and Cuba), sub-Saharan Africa (South Africa), parts of former Soviet
      Union (Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia), whereas the lowest rates were found in
      Asia (Thailand and Turkmenistan). Prostate cancer incidence rates during the most
      recent 5 yr declined (five countries) or stabilized (35 countries), after
      increasing for many years; in contrast, rates continued to increase for four
      countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. During the most recent 5 data years,
      mortality rates among the 76 countries examined increased (three countries),
      remained stable (59 countries), or decreased (14 countries). CONCLUSIONS: As
      evident from available data, prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates have
      been on the decline or have stabilized recently in many countries, with decreases
      more pronounced in high-income countries. These trends may reflect a decline in
      prostate-specific antigen testing (incidence) and improvements in treatment
      (mortality). PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined recent trends in prostate cancer
      incidence and mortality rates in 44 and 76 countries, respectively, and found
      that rates in most countries stabilized or decreased.
